	Pod and Test fixes by Andy Lester

0.12	Tuesday 30th September, 2003
	Added 'trustme' so that you don't have to lie about subs being private
	when the module fails to find their docs.  Work by David Cantrell.

	Pulled HISTORY out into a Changes file.

	Deprecated and gutted Pod::Coverage::Overloader.  The ignored
	patterns in the base class now include qr/^\(/ which is all it
	really did only in a stupidly complex manner.

0.11	2002-02-27
	Sort the uncovered subs reported from the import form.  From a
	bug report from Tels.

0.10	2002-02-18
	Added Pod::Coverage::CountParents which counts the Pod
	sections from higher in the inheritance tree (it walks @ISA).

	Refactored C<_get_pods> into its own method to allow this.

0.09	2001-12-17
	Fixed a typo in mstevens' name (oopsie)

	Added C<examples/script-covered> based on an email exchange.

	Modified the import form so that if given one argument it's
	assumed to be the package.  From a suggestion by Mark Fowler.

	Changed tracing to use optimisable constants.

	Added why_unrated.

0.08 2001-11-14
	Paul Johnson beat me to making Pod::Coverage a Devel::Cover
	plugin, so that's one less thing in the TODO section.

	Ran the code through perltidy, made some of the changes it
	suggested.

	Worked over the parsing of the also_private flag to give it more
	consistent semantics

	Assimilated C<examples/pod_cover.t> from Tels

0.07
	Implemented _CvGV based upon code from Robin Houston.  This
	removes the dependency on Devel::Peek (the CPAN version of
	Devel::Peek doesn't supply CvGV).  This also happily makes the
	module work with perl 5.005_03.

	Fixed a bug in the import routine which was preventing the use
	form of derived classes.  Reports a module is unrated if
	coverage returns undef.

	Added Pod::Checker::Overloader.

0.06
	First cut at making inheritance easy.
	Pod::Checker::ExportOnly isa Pod::Checker which only checks
	what Exporter is allowed to hand out.

	Fixed up bad docs from the 0.05 release.

0.05
	Used Pod::Find to deal with alternative locations for pod
	files.  

	Introduced pod_from.  

	Merged some patches from Schwern. 
	Added in covered.  

	Assimilated C<examples/check_installed> as contributed by
	Kirrily "Skud" Robert <skud@cpan.org>.  

	Copes with multple functions documented by one section.  

	Added uncovered as a synonym for naked.

0.04
	Just 0.03 with a correctly generated README file

0.03
	Applied a patch from Dave Rolsky (barely 6 hours after release
	of 0.02) to improve scanning of pod markers.

0.02
	Fixed up the import form.  

	Removed dependency on List::Util.

	Added naked method.  
	
	Exposed private configuration.

0.01
	As #london.pm invaded Brighton, people taked about
	documentation standards.  mstevens scribbled something down,
	richardc coded it, the rest is ponies.
